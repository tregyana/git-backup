I'm just a broken machine
I can't do anything
My wheels have started to jam
My wheels jam, my

I'm just a broken machine
With all the layers of dust

Chorus:
Take a little spark
From a battery
Electricity
And put me back together
Back together
Yeah

Hey I'm a broken machine
I can do anything
I've got nothing to hide
Now I start to dream
I'm a mechanical thing
With a layer of shit
And nothing bothers me now
My wheels are my wheels

Hey, I'm a broken machine
I can do anything
I've got nothing to hide
Now I start to dream
I'm a mechanical thing (take a little spark)
I can do anything
Nothing bothers me now
Now I start to dream
